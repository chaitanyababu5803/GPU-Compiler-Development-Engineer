GPGPU-Sim TUTORIALS
GPGPU-Sim is a cycle-level simulator for modeling GPU microarchitectures and running CUDA or OpenCL workloads without the need for physical hardware. Below are the primary tutorials and resources for getting started. 
1. Official Getting Started Guide
The most direct way to start is the GPGPU-Sim Manual, which covers the core workflow: 
University of Wisconsin–Madison
University of Wisconsin–Madison
Installation: Requirements include gcc, make, zlib, bison, and flex. You must set environment variables like GPGPUSIM_ROOT and CUDAHOME in your .bashrc.
Building: Use make in the root directory to build the simulator.
Running: To run a CUDA application, you typically link it dynamically by adding the GPGPU-Sim library path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

2. Video Tutorials (Academic)
For a structured classroom approach, the ECE 695 GPGPU-Sim Tutorial series is highly recommended: 
Part 1: Overview: Focuses on the architectural components modeled, including the SIMT core and memory system.
Part 2: Software (SW): Covers the interface to CUDA API, PTX parsing, and simulator startup details.

3. Modern Setup: Docker & Accel-Sim
Recent research often uses Accel-Sim, a fork of GPGPU-Sim that supports modern NVIDIA architectures like Volta and Ampere.

Docker Approach: You can skip manual dependency management by pulling a pre-configured image: docker pull pli33/gpgpusim:cuda_3.1_3.
Quickstart Guide: The SST QuickStart provides instructions for integrating GPGPU-Sim with the Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST) for full-system simulation.

4. Advanced Configuration & Visualization
AerialVision: A performance visualizer included with GPGPU-Sim. Run python aerialvision.py to plot data from your simulation logs.
Configuration Files: You must provide a gpgpusim.config file in your application's directory to define GPU parameters like the number of shader cores or DRAM timing.

NASIC EXMAP;LE WITH CODE
To run a basic example in GPGPU-Sim, you need three components in your working directory: a CUDA source file (.cu), a configuration file (gpgpusim.config), and an interconnect configuration (config_fermi_islip.icnt).

1. Simple CUDA Code: Vector Addition 
Create a file named vector_add.cu. This code adds two vectors of size 4096 on the GPU.

cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Vector Addition Kernel
__global__ void vector_add(const float *a, const float *b, float *c, int n) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < n) c[idx] = a[idx] + b[idx];
}

int main() {
    int n = 4096;
    size_t size = n * sizeof(float);
    // ... Host/Device memory allocation, data copy, and kernel launch (1D grid) ...
    // ... (See for full code example) ...
    return 0;
}
Use code with caution.

2. Required Setup Steps
Ensure the simulator is linked properly to intercept CUDA calls:

Compile: nvcc vector_add.cu -o vectorAdd -lcudart
Configurations: Copy config files from $GPGPUSIM_ROOT/configs/tested-cfgs/SM2_GTX480/ to your run directory
Run: Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the GPGPU-Sim library and execute: ./vectorAdd

3. Verifying Execution
If successful, the terminal will display "GPGPU-Sim: *** Initialization ***" followed by detailed performance statistics, including IPC, DRAM utilization, and cache hit rates.

Would you like to know how to modify the gpgpusim.config file to simulate a different GPU architecture, like a Tesla V100?
