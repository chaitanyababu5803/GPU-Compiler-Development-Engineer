(ELF),Binary Tools: Knowledge of object file formats (ELF), debugging formats (DWARF), and disassemblers (e.g., NVDISASM)
Building or analyzing low-level software requires a deep understanding of how code is packaged and examined. Here is a breakdown of the core binary formats and tools essential for this work. 
1. Object File Formats (ELF)
The Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) is the standard for Unix-like systems, used for executables, object code, and shared libraries.

Dual-View Structure: ELF files provide two complementary "views":
Linking View (Sections): Used by linkers to combine files. Common sections include .text (code), .data (initialized data), and .symtab (symbols).
Execution View (Segments): Used by the OS loader to map the file into memory. Defined in the Program Header Table.
Header Metadata: Every ELF begins with a header containing a "magic number" (0x7F 'E' 'L' 'F'), machine architecture, and entry point.

2. Debugging Formats (DWARF)
DWARF (Debugging With Arbitrary Record Formats) is the industry standard for mapping machine code back to high-level source code.

Tree Structure: It represents program data as a tree of Debugging Information Entries (DIEs), where nodes represent functions, variables, and types.
Key Sections:
.debug_info: The "meat" of DWARF, containing symbols, types, and scopes.
.debug_line: Maps memory addresses to specific source file line numbers.
.debug_frame: Provides call frame information for stack unwinding.

3. GPU Disassembly: NVDISASM 
In the NVIDIA ecosystem, NVDISASM is an advanced tool used to extract human-readable assembly from standalone CUDA binary (.cubin) files.

Rich Output Features: Unlike cuobjdump, nvdisasm provides:
Control Flow Analysis: Can generate a Control Flow Graph (CFG) in DOT format for visualization in tools like Graphviz.
Register Liveness: Displays the life range of registers (general and predicate) for each instruction line.
Source Correlation: Uses the .debug_line section (via the -g flag) to annotate assembly with original source code.
